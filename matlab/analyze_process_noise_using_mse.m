% Process noise analysis
%
% The process noise is considered to be the difference between the Gazebo
% model state and what the fitted LTI system model accounts for. This
% scripts visualizes the process noise and calculates its standard
% deviation.

%% Determine remaining noise after linearizing the system
% Linear system is fitted to noisy data from input to output. However, the
% fit still has some error remaining. The linear system thus does not
% account for all output noise, given a certain input sequence. The
% remaining noise should thus be considered as process noise
