% LTI system model fit to Gazebo data
%
% Fitting the LTI model of the Jackal robot to the Gazebo data by
% optimising for its tunable parameters d_long and d_lat using the
% fminsearch function.
% Note that the interpolated data provided by mat file 
% Linsys_fit_Gazebo_u-y_interpolated is needed to run this script.
